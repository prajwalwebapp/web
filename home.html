                Dear Friends,

I am happy to share the news that the 73 rd Annual Convocation will be held on 30th October, 2023 in physical mode. The Convocation is an academic festival and much-awaited event for the students who will receive gold medals, degrees and cash prizes on their success.After taking part in curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities, the students finally leave their alma mater as ‘academic ambassador’ of Karnatak University, acquiring knowledge, confidence and future outlook.

As we know that every year the 1 st November is celebrated all over Karnataka as Nadahabba. It is on the 1 st November, 1956 the state of Mysore took its birth as an independent state and subsequently, it was renamed as ‘Karnataka’ on the 1 st November, 1973, preserving the culture, language and unity of the Kannada people. The people of Karnataka rejoice in this festival. Karnatak University too celebrates the festival in a benefitting way. Since last year 2022, we instituted Arive Guru honor bestowed on the eminent men and women who have made invaluable contributions and service in their fields. This year too we are happy to honor eminent people being chosen by the experts on the occasion.

The results of the various examinations are being declared so that the students can plan their careers. I wish all the outgoing students a great future.

Admission process to the PG degree programs has commenced. I well come all the fresh students and hope they will make best use of the academic ecosystem prevailing in the campus, a campus of 75 years experience, a campus which has given Four Jnana Peetha awardees and hundreds of Padma Awardees.

Shortly we are all going to celebrate Dasara Festivities (or Vijayadashmi) as Nada Habba. This festival is a symbol of ‘the good’ defeating ‘the evil’, and therefore, I pray goddess Durga to give us strength to fight the evil in us. On this occasion, may Durga Mata bestow blessing upon all of you for a happy and peaceful life.

Warm Wishes to All,

Professor K. B. Gudasi
Vice-Chancellor
